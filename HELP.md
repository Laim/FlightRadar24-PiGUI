This just explains what each setting does

## Save Feeder
This saves your feeder configuration, i.e URL and Port. This is seperate from other options, meaning you can have the other settings configured without needing to have a permanent feeder URL defined.

## Automatic Refresh
Will refresh the data from your pi24 based on the interval you provide, which by default is 5 seconds if enabled.

## Append Log
Appends the log from your pi24 so you can have more than the top 100, each time it refreshes it will just add the current log to the already pulled one.  Please note however that it is not smart and you will definitely get duplicate log data.
